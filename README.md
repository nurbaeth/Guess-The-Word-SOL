# Guess The Word

## Overview
**Guess The Word** is an on-chain word-guessing game built on Solidity. Players attempt to guess a predefined secret word. Each guess is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness. The game ends when a player correctly guesses the word. No bets or rewardsâ€”just pure gameplay!

## Features
- ðŸ”’ **Fully on-chain** â€” all guesses are stored transparently.
- ðŸŽ® **Simple gameplay** â€” guess the word and win!
- ðŸ‘¤ **One guess per player** â€” each address can submit only one guess.
- ðŸ›‘ **Game ends automatically** when the correct word is guessed. 

## How It Works
1. The contract owner deploys the game with a secret word and an optional hint.
2. Players submit their guesses via the `guessWord` function. 
3. If a guess is correct, the game ends and no further guesses are allowed. 

## Deployment
To deploy the contract, use Remix, Hardhat, or Foundry: 
```solidity
constructor(string memory _secretWord, string memory hint)
```
Example:
```solidity
GuessTheWord("blockchain", "A technology for decentralized records")
```

## Interacting with the Contract
### Guess a word
```solidity
guessWord("blockchain")
```
If the guess is correct, the game will end, and no further guesses will be accepted.

## Events
- `GameStarted(string hint)`: Emitted when the game begins.
- `WordGuessed(address player, string word)`: Emitted when a player submits a guess.
- `GameEnded(address winner)`: Emitted when the correct word is guessed.
